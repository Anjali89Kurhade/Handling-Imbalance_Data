# Handling-Imbalance_Data
What is imbalanced data?
Imbalanced data refers to those types of datasets where the target class has an uneven distribution of observations, 
i.e one class label has a very high number of observations and the other has a very low number of observations. 


the main problem with imbalanced dataset prediction is how accurately are we actually predicting both majority and minority class?
 Letâ€™s assume we are going to predict disease from an existing dataset where for every 100 records only 5 patients are diagnosed with the disease. So, the majority class is 95% with no disease and the minority class is only 5% with the disease.
 Now, assume our model predicts that all 100 out of 100 patients have no disease.
 For an imbalanced class dataset F1 score is a more appropriate metric
Methods Solution:
A) SMOTE 
B)Resample the training set 1) Oversampling  , 2) Undersampling  , 3) Use K-fold Cross-Validation
C) Use the right evaluation metrics
D) BalancedBaggingClassifier.
